# simplecctv

A proof of concpet app to run CCTV with MediaMTX. This Docker Image will contain 
  - a copy of MediaMTX
  - Nginx proxying everything, so you get one nice port
  - a hand-written index.html, which opens every camera connected to the server at the time of loading it
This is an early beta, check TODO.md for what is planned for this project.
